# CollabCMU

**AI-Powered Club Collaboration Discovery Platform for Carnegie Mellon University**

CollabCMU is an intelligent platform that reduces siloing between student organizations at Carnegie Mellon University by automatically discovering cross-club collaboration opportunities. Built for the [Claude Hackathon](https://claude.ai/hackathon), this application demonstrates how Claude AI can strengthen campus community engagement through smart partnership matching.

## 🎯 Hackathon Context

This project was created for the **Claude Hackathon** to showcase the power of Anthropic's Claude AI in solving real-world organizational challenges. The hackathon challenged developers to build innovative applications that leverage Claude's advanced reasoning and natural language capabilities.

### Why This Problem?

Student organizations at universities often operate in isolation, missing valuable collaboration opportunities with complementary clubs. CollabCMU addresses this by:
- **Reducing siloing** between organizations with shared interests
- **Preventing duplicate efforts** and event overlap
- **Maximizing resource efficiency** through strategic partnerships
- **Strengthening community engagement** across campus

## ✨ Features

### Intelligent Matching with Claude AI
- **AI-Powered Compatibility Analysis**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 analyzes club profiles (goals, offerings, needs) to identify complementary partnerships
- **Match Scoring**: Generates compatibility scores (0-100) with detailed reasoning
- **Collaboration Idea Generation**: Creates 3-5 specific, actionable collaboration proposals for each match
- **Auto-Generated Partnership Proposals**: Professional partnership proposals ready to present to club leadership
- **Ready-to-Send Outreach Emails**: Personalized outreach messages that can be sent immediately

### Club Profile Management
- Create and manage comprehensive club profiles
- Define goals, offerings, needs, and categories
- Browse all registered clubs with search and filtering
- View detailed club information and compatibility potential

### Smart Fallback System
- Heuristic-based matching when Claude API times out
- Ensures reliable service even during high API load
- Category overlap and complementary resource analysis
